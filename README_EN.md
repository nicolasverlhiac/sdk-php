# Prerequisites

* PHP 5.4 or higher
* Opional: [cURL](http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) installed.

# Installation

## From sources

PHP classes are in the `src/Payname` folder.

Simply download them and copy them in your project, for example in a `vendor/Payname/` folder.

## Via Composer

Composer integration will come "soon".

# Configuration

1. Copy `Payname/Config.class.php.sample` into `Payname/Config.class.php`
2. Simply edit `Payname/Config.class.php` and write your ID and secret (available in your administration panel)

**HINTS:**

* Use the test secret key to switch the SDK to test mode.
* If account is set to "OAuth and simple", SDK will automatically auth on every request.
  Otherwise, use of `Auth::token()` and `Payname::token()` is required.
* By default, the SDK will use standard PHP functions for HTTP calls.
  To use cURL instead, set `Config::USE_CURL` to `true`


# Examples

Integration exemples are available in the `examples/` folder.

They show ways to use User, Popup and other features of Payname API.


# Documentation

PHPDoc documentation is available in `doc/` folder.


# Tests

Requires [phpunit](https://phpunit.de/)

Unit tests are in `tests/` folder.

For now, work is still in progress.
